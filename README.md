Code Functionality of basicmathoperation.py Explained:

1. Input from user:

num1 = input("Enter the first number: ")
num2 = input("Enter the second number: ")

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers as input (they are taken as strings initially).



2. Conversion to float:

a = float(num1)
b = float(num2)

The input strings are converted to floating-point numbers so they can be used in arithmetic operations.



3. Blank print (optional):

print()

Prints a blank line for better readability of the output.



4. Arithmetic operations and results:

print("Addition: ", a + b)
print("Subtraction: ", a - b)
print("Multiplication: ", a * b)
if b != 0
  print("Division: ", a / b)
else;
  print("Division cannot be divided by 0")

Performs and prints:

Addition of the two numbers.

Subtraction of the second number from the first.

Multiplication of the two numbers.

Division of the first number by the second and also handles error when number is divided by 0

Code Functionality of greetings.py Explained:

N1 = input("Enter your first Name: ")
N2 = input("Enter your second Name: ")

The program prompts the user to enter their first name and second name (i.e., last name).

These are stored as strings in variables N1 and N2.


a = ("!")

The variable a is just a string containing an exclamation mark (!), to be used at the end of the full name.


Fname = N1 + " " + N2 + a

This line concatenates the first name,second name,the exclamation mark and " "(used for space between name) into a single string called Fname.


print()

Prints a blank line for better output formatting.


print("Hello,", Fname, "Welcome to the Python Program.")

Displays the final greeting message using the full name.
